# Uncharted Journeys - Encounter Design Guide

This document serves as a reference for creating new regions that match the writing style and design patterns of the official Uncharted Journeys book.

## Region Structure

Each region in Uncharted Journeys follows this structure:

### 1. Region Introduction (1 paragraph)
- Sets the tone and atmosphere of the region
- Describes the defining characteristics (terrain, climate, culture)
- Hints at the types of peoples and dangers found there
- Example (Frontiers): "These are the borders where settled lands meet the untamed wilds; a last familiar place before plunging into the unknown. These regions are characterised by their great expanse, wide vistas and big skies; often swampy or dusty, they are shaped by the other regions they stand between."

### 2. Flavor Tables (10 entries each)
- **Weather**: Atmospheric conditions from pleasant to catastrophic
- **Flora and Fauna**: Wildlife and plant life characteristic of the region
- **Local Inhabitants**: NPCs and communities the party might encounter
- **Points of Interest**: Landmarks and locations worth visiting
- **Possible Journeys**: Adventure hooks and quest ideas

### 3. Encounter Tables (12 types, 10 entries each = 120 encounters per region)

## Encounter Type Analysis

### A Chance Meeting
**Purpose**: Social encounters with NPCs - travelers, merchants, pilgrims, or unusual individuals
**Tone**: Generally neutral to friendly; opportunities for roleplay, information gathering, or aid
**Design Patterns**:
- Introduce a memorable NPC with a distinctive trait or profession
- Present a situation or need that invites interaction
- Leave room for the party to help, trade, or simply converse
- Often includes hooks to other adventures

**Writing Style**:
- Opens with vivid description of the NPC or situation
- Uses present tense for immediacy
- Names specific creature types when appropriate (e.g., "Lizardfolk", "Dragonborn")
- Often ends with an open-ended opportunity

**Example Titles**: "Circuit Judge", "Grace for Sale", "First Contact", "Pony Express", "Map Swap"

**Full Example** (Frontiers #9 - Map Swap):
> "The party encounters a Half-Orc pathfinder who is trying to help a neighbouring nation establish a fort along the frontier. He is willing to share his map and insights with the party in return for a look at theirs. He tells them that the fort captain is looking for a party to scout the area beyond the fort's immediate territory."

---

### Hidden Reserves
**Purpose**: Resource discovery - supplies, treasure, or useful locations
**Tone**: Mysterious, often with a twist or dark undertone
**Design Patterns**:
- Present an abandoned or unusual location
- Describe what can be found/salvaged
- Include a mystery about why it's there or what happened
- Sometimes hint at danger that has passed (or lingers)

**Writing Style**:
- Emphasizes discovery and exploration
- Includes specific loot or benefit descriptions
- Often poses questions that create atmosphere
- May reference skill checks for additional discoveries

**Example Titles**: "Abandoned Mining Camp", "Airship Wreckage", "Icy Mystery", "Reanimation Ranch", "Liquid Gold"

**Full Example** (Frontiers #7 - Reanimation Ranch):
> "The party come across a bustling farm, but on closer inspection, every worker is either a Zombie or a Skeleton. If they investigate, the farm owner is indeed a Necromancer, who claims to be trying to aid the community with 'efficient and basically free labour.' She offers the party as much produce as they can carry if they can help to improve her reputation with the neighbouring farmers."

---

### A Bump in the Road
**Purpose**: Obstacles requiring the Outrider's skills to overcome
**Tone**: Challenging but surmountable; tests navigation and survival
**Design Patterns**:
- Present a terrain or situation blocking progress

**Writing Style**:

- Uses the Outrider as the key role

**Example Titles**: "River Ford", "Swampland", "Bovine Blockade", "The Holy Pass", "Secret Quicksand"

**Full Example** (Frontiers #4 - The Holy Pass):
> "A community at the mouth of a mountain pass believes that the pass leads to the home of the gods. They allow no one to enter the pass except to accompany funeral processions that leave bodies on a 'sacred ridge' not far from the village. An Intelligence (Religion) check or a Charisma (Deception) check by the Outrider can convince the community that the party should be allowed to pass."

---

**Example Titles**: "Buried Them Deep", "Wounded Soldier", "Trapped!", "Party Foals", "Dead and Unburied"

**Full Example** (Frontiers #6 - Dead and Unburied):
> "A grieving woman approaches the party. Her recently deceased partner is banned from being buried in the town's cemetery for being a Wererat. The group can help her in one of these ways: a Carpenter's Tools check to create a beautiful casket, a Strength (Athletics) check to dig a fresh grave, or a Charisma (Intimidation) check to convince the town to bury her beloved."

---

### Danger Afoot
**Purpose**: Combat encounters or immediate threats

---

## Writing Conventions

### Creature References
- Use **bold** for creature names that reference stat blocks
- Examples: **Mimic**, **Gnolls**, **Young Red Dragon**, **Werewolf**

### Skill Check Format
- Format: "Skill (Specialization)" - e.g., "Intelligence (Investigation)", "Charisma (Persuasion)"
- Group checks: "A group [Skill] check"
- Contested checks: "a contested [Skill] check"

### Title Style
- 2-4 words, evocative and memorable
- Often uses wordplay, alliteration, or references
- Should hint at content without spoiling
- Examples: "Liquid Gold", "Ghost Riders", "Fool's Gold", "Hagspitality"

### Description Length
- 3-5 sentences typical
- Complete narrative arc: setup, situation, opportunity/resolution
- Enough detail to run, flexible enough to adapt

### Tone Consistency
- Match the encounter type's expected tone
- Frontiers: rugged, pioneering, lawless, opportunity-filled
- Each region has its own flavor that should permeate all encounters
